# Key Insights and Discoveries

**Note**: While the Bun-related insights below are valid and were discovered during development, this project now uses Node.js v20+ for better compatibility with Browserbase and other tools.

## Playwright + Proxy Caching Solution

### Discovery
When using proxies with Playwright, the browser's native HTTP cache is disabled. This leads to 0% bandwidth savings and every resource being re-downloaded on every request.

### Solution
We implemented caching at the Playwright API level using `route.fetch()` to intercept and cache responses:

```javascript
const response = await route.fetch();
await route.fulfill({ response });
```

This approach works perfectly with Node.js and provides full caching functionality even when using authenticated proxies.

### Impact
- Full caching functionality with proxies
- 40-98% bandwidth savings
- Works with all proxy configurations

## Cache Implementation Insights

### 1. Browser Cache Disabled with Proxies
When using proxies in Playwright, the browser's native HTTP cache is completely disabled. This results in:
- 0% bandwidth savings on repeat visits
- Every resource re-downloaded
- Increased costs with paid proxies

### 2. Application-Layer Caching Works
By intercepting at the Playwright API level with `page.route()`, we can implement caching that:
- Works with any proxy configuration
- Provides 40-98% bandwidth savings
- Maintains full control over cache behavior

### 3. Performance Results
Testing with real sites through proxies:
- First page load: Downloads all resources
- Subsequent pages: 34-93% cache hit rate
- Load time improvement: 40-98% faster
- Bandwidth saved: Up to 93%

## Module Design Insights

### 1. Separation of Concerns
Each module has a single, clear responsibility:
- Browser module: ONLY creates browsers
- Proxy module: ONLY manages proxy data
- Cache module: ONLY handles caching

This makes the code:
- Easy to understand
- Simple to test
- Flexible to compose

### 2. Error Propagation
We deliberately don't handle errors in the modules. This allows:
- Callers to handle errors appropriately for their context
- Better debugging (full stack traces)
- No hidden failures

### 3. Explicit Resource Management
The browser module returns both the browser AND a cleanup function:
```javascript
const { browser, cleanup } = await createBrowser(options);
```
This makes resource cleanup explicit and prevents forgotten cleanups.

## Proxy Configuration Insights

### 1. Proxy Format
Proxies must be formatted correctly for Playwright:
```javascript
{
  server: 'http://proxy.example.com:8080',
  username: 'user',
  password: 'pass'
}
```

### 2. Authentication in URL
Despite what you might expect, putting credentials in the proxy URL doesn't work:
```javascript
// This DOESN'T work
proxy: { server: 'http://user:pass@proxy.example.com:8080' }
```

## Testing Insights

### 1. Network Dependencies
Some tests require external network access. When tests fail with ECONNREFUSED or timeouts, it's often due to:
- Network restrictions
- Proxy authentication issues
- Site availability

### 2. Node.js Version Requirements
This project requires Node.js v20 or later for:
- Native .env file support (--env-file flag)
- Modern ES modules
- Stable async/await performance

## Credits

The caching implementation was inspired by the [browser-caching](https://github.com/mushstyle/browser-caching) project, which demonstrated how to implement request-level caching in Playwright.

## Future Considerations

### 1. Browser Pooling
The current implementation creates new browsers each time. Future enhancements could include:
- Browser instance pooling
- Session reuse
- Connection limits

### 2. Persistent Caching
Current cache is in-memory only. Future options:
- File-based cache
- Redis backend
- Cross-session cache sharing

### 3. Proxy Rotation
Current implementation uses a single proxy. Future features:
- Automatic proxy rotation
- Failure detection and retry
- Performance-based selection
